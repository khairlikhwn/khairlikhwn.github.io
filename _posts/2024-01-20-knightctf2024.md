This is my attempt solving the challenges after the ctf ends by referring to other writeups.

## Web / Fluxx (33 solves)

> Recently I have made a simple app for monitoring and analyzing metrics, events, and real-time data.I used a database which is designed for handling high volumes of timestamped data. But I think its vulnerable find it and get he flag.
> 

I visited this link `http://66.228.53.87:9001/` and it displayed:

`Please visit /query?data= to travel with time.`

I referred to this [InfluxDB NoSQL Injection](https://rafa.hashnode.dev/influxdb-nosql-injection) and found a payload to leak the bucket name.

The InfluxDB queries support regex with theÂ `=~`Â operation, so the logic behind the conditionÂ `r.name =~ /^a.*/`Â is that it will beÂ `true`Â if a bucket name starts with the letterÂ `a`.

```
") |> yield(name: "1337") 
buckets() |> filter(fn: (r) => r.name =~ /^a.*/ and die(msg:r.name)) 
//
```

Since the flag starts with K, I change `^a.*` to `^K.*` , url encode the payload and send it using burpsuite.

I referred to this [403 & 401 Bypasses](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/403-and-401-bypasses) and tried brute-force all the different http headers using burp suite intruder.

And got the flag with the `Forwarded-For` header.

## Web / Gain Access 1 (118 Solves)

> The web challenges are very much similar to real life application bugs.Â **This is going to be a series of Gain Access with 3 challenges unlocks upon solving one by one.**Â By solving these challenges, you'll gain a practical knowledge of Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilites as well as business logic error. The only difference is you'll not get any bounty but you'll get flags. Give it a try. And keep in mind, Don't make it hard, keep it simple. All the best. Solve the challenges & be a cyber knight.

Tried adding `' -- -` at the end of the email and submit using burp suite.
