Add referer header with [`http://flagland.internal/`](http://flagland.internal/)

Add query parameters `?secret=1`

Based on hint, secret is most likely http. Change the parameters.

After analyzing the files, this part in `[main.py](http://main.py)` caught my eye:

```python
@app.get('/api/read/<path:name>')
def readNovel(name):
    name = unquote(name)
    if(not name.startswith('public/')):
        return {'success': False, 'msg': 'You can only read public novels!'}, 400
    buf = readFile(name).split(' ')
    buf = ' '.join(buf[0:session['words_balance']])+'... Charge your account to unlock more of the novel!'
    return {'success': True, 'msg': buf}
```

It looks like path traversal can be used to read the flag by double url encoding `..` to `%252E%252E`

## Web / Novel reader 2 (125 solves)

> Submit the second flag of "Novel Reader" here
> 

From the private novel text file:

```
Once a upon time there was a flag. The flag was read like this: MAPNA{test-flag}. FIN.
```

I think we need to read the private novel to get the flag. I tried path traversal but to no avail. It seems like word balance = `0` is not enough 

![Untitled](Untitled%2011.png)

I can set the word balance to `-1` and it will be like `join(buf[0:-1)` which can read the whole text file.

```python
    buf = ' '.join(buf[0:session['words_balance']])+'... Charge your account to unlock more of the novel!'
```

Read the private text again using path traversal.

## Web / Advanced JSON Cutifier (88 solves)

> My homework was to write a JSON beautifier. Just Indenting JSON files was too boring that's why I decided to add some features to my project using a popular (More than 1k stars on GitHub!! ) library to make my project more exciting.

**Important: You can't read any file other thanÂ `/flag.txt`Â on the remote environment.

Analyzing the player.go file, thereâ€™s a github repo that has been redacted.

```go
import (
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "github.com/REDACTED/REDACTED"
)
```

Trying to get some error and I got: `Expected a comma before next field`

![Untitled](Untitled%2014.png)

Google the error and I found https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet github repo which has> 1k stars.

Based on challenge description, we might need to read flag.txt file. I google how to read files go-jsonnet and found this https://github.com/google/jsonnet/issues/238. It mentions that we can use `importstr` to read a file from a system. 

```
(importstr "myfile.txt")
```

I tried using `importstr` to read `flag.txt` 

```json
{"wow so advanced!!": importstr "flag.txt"}
```

and got the flag

```json
{
   "wow so advanced!!": "MAPNA{5uch-4-u53ful-f347ur3-a23f98d}\n\n"
}
```
